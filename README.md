# TDPlanner
> TDPlanner is a To Do List application which uses mathematical calculations to plan the order of your day.

TDPlanner uses basic mathematics to sort the order of which the tasks listed should be done. It even provides a visual representation of the graph using the `matplotlib` package in Python.

TDPlanner (To Do Planner) is written in Python 3.9 and uses TKinter GUI to function. TDPlanner uses this TKinter [dark theme](https://github.com/formazione/tkinter_dark_theme) script from [Formazione](https://github.com/formazione) for the GUI.
